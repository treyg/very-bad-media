  "description": "This is a fan built site for the media discussed on the Very Bad Wizards podcast. The site is built with Next JS and Chakra UI. The media lists are automated by running the RSS feed for the podcast through the Open AI api and analyzing the text to find the media discussed. The data is then stored in a redis KV store. There may be some errors in the data, but it will update daily and will dramatically improve when I get access to the newer API model."
